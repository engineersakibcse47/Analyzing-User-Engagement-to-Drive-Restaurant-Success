In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project investigates the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

## Research Objectives

- **Explore Time Trends:**  
  Examine temporal patterns in user engagement.
- **Compare Engagement:**  
  Identify differences between high-rated and low-rated businesses.
- **Geographic Variation:**  
  Assess how restaurant success metrics vary across states and cities.
- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Explore correlations between review sentiment (useful, funny, cool) and success metrics.
- **Elite User Impact:**  
  Compare engagement of elite users with non-elite users.

## Hypotheses

1. Higher user engagement is positively correlated across reviews, tips, and check-ins.
